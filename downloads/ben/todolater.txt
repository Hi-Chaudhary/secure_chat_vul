Love it. You’ve now got a working hub topology with signed, session-encrypted envelopes, TOFU pinning, replay defense, DM relay, and group fan-out. To hit the “Advanced Secure Protocol” brief and impress the marker, here’s what’s still worth doing (in priority order), plus where to add it.

High-impact (do these)

True end-to-end secrecy through the hub (double-wrap).
Today the hub can read DMs/groups (hop-by-hop AES-GCM). Add an inner, end-to-end blob:

Sender: inner = {"type":"PM|GROUP","to":X,"from":me,"text":...,"ts":now} → JSON → AES-GCM with random key k → RSA-OAEP wrap k to recipient’s pinned RSA pubkey → put as {"e2e_key":"<b64>","e2e_ct":"<b64>","e2e_tag":"<b64>","e2e_iv":"<b64>"} inside the outer payload that hubs forward.

Hops: route by the clear to (in the outer), but never see inner plaintext.

Receiver: unwrap k with its RSA privkey, AES-decrypt inner, display.
Where: handlers.encrypt_and_send (build inner), _dispatch_payload (if e2e_* present and to==self, open it; if not to==self, forward unchanged).

Inner authorship authenticity.
Right now payload["from"] is just a field—any relay could change it. Add an inner signature:

Sender signs the inner JSON with RSA-PSS; add from_sig.

Receiver verifies from_sig with the pinned pubkey for from.
Where: use crypto.sign_data/verify (you already have PSS helpers) when building/consuming the inner blob.

Offline queue + retry (at hub, optional at edges).
If Ben is offline, the hub should queue and deliver when Ben reconnects.
Where: keep self._outbox[to_id]: deque[envelope] in Handlers; on send failure (no session), stash; on HELLO/SESSION_INIT for to_id, flush. Persist to disk if you want bonus points (simple JSONL per peer).

Security/robustness polish

Frame cap fix.
MAX_WS_FRAME is set to 200 (bytes). Change it to something sane like 200*1024 and keep the early drop in handlers.on_message (is_frame_too_large).

DM multi-hop loop-safety.
You added group mid+ttl+seen_set. Do the same for DMs to be safe if you ever add a second hub: generate mid on first send, carry ttl (e.g., 5), drop if seen/ttl==0.

Stricter validators.
In protocol.validate_payload: enforce max lengths (e.g., text ≤ 4KB), presence/shape of to, allowed chars in IDs, base64 sanity for any e2e_* fields.

Rate limiting / flood control.
Per-peer token bucket in Handlers (messages/second & bytes/second). On excess, temporarily drop or close.

Key rotation + re-pin command.
Add CLI /rotate-keys (generate new RSA pair, publish) and /pin --peer <id> to update trustmap.json. Document the operational steps (briefly justify TOFU + rotation).

Integrity for files end-to-end.
You already hash received chunks; when you add E2E: include file metadata (name,size,sha256) inside the inner signed blob, and let hubs forward chunks blindly.

UX/testing/documentation (quick wins)

CLI help + commands.
Add /sendfile --to <id> --path <f>, /peers, /sessions, /trust (list pins), /ping <id> (creates/refreshes session).

Integration tests.
A tiny ./tools/e2e_test.py that spins three peers (hub + 2 members) in-process and asserts: list works, DM routes via hub, group fans out, replay is dropped, over-large frame is dropped, offline queue delivers on reconnect.

Threat model & protocol doc refresh.
In protocol.md: draw the message flow (HELLO → SESSION_INIT → ENCRYPTED), specify inner/outer structure, what is authenticated where, TOFU process, replay window, routing/TTL, and limitations (no FS-perfect forward secrecy, etc.). This earns lots of rubric points.

Logging levels.
Replace prints with a tiny logger (INFO/WARN/SEC) and redact secrets; include peer/ts in lines for audits.

Minimal code sketch for the double-wrap (DM)

(Pseudocode only – slot into your existing helpers)

Sender (in encrypt_and_send when to!=BROADCAST):

inner = {"type":"MSG_PRIVATE","to":to_id,"from":self.state.self_id,"text":text,"ts":now_ts()}
inner_json = json.dumps(inner, separators=(',',':')).encode()
inner_sig = sign_bytes(self.priv, inner_json)
inner["from_sig"] = b64e(inner_sig)
k = gen_aes_key()
e = aes_encrypt(k, inner_json)
wrapped_k = rsa_wrap_key(recipient_pubkey, k)
outer_payload = {"type":"RELAY_DM","to":to_id, "e2e_key":b64e(wrapped_k), "e2e_iv":e["iv"], "e2e_ct":e["ct"], "e2e_tag":e["tag"]}
# then send outer_payload exactly like you do today (hop-by-hop), including your existing envelope signature.


Receiver (in _dispatch_payload):

elif ptype == "RELAY_DM":
    if payload["to"] != self.state.self_id:
        # forward unchanged (plus ttl/mid if you added)
        return await forward()
    k = rsa_unwrap_key(self.priv, payload["e2e_key"])
    inner = aes_decrypt(k, payload["e2e_iv"], payload["e2e_ct"], payload["e2e_tag"])
    msg = json.loads(inner.decode())
    # verify inner authorship
    pub = RSA.import_key(b64d(self.state.get_peer(msg["from"]).pubkey_pem_b64))
    if not verify_bytes(pub, inner, b64d(msg["from_sig"])):
        print("[!] bad inner signature from", msg["from"]); return
    print(f"[PM from {msg['from']}] {msg['text']}")


(Do the analogous thing for RELAY_GROUP with your mid/ttl/seen_set.)

If you want, I can generate a clean git diff with the exact changes (frame cap fix, DM+group double-wrap + inner sig, DM loop-safety, offline queue skeleton) that you can paste-apply.
